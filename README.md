A Fabric mod that brings Quilt mods into the Fabric ecosystem. Very experimental.

## FAQ (probably)
### Why?
To be honest with you, I was bored and depressed, so I decided to just do this
out of pure curiosity.

### What does this do???
Basically, it tries its best to reimplement Quilt Loader APIs (and potential internals) for
Quilt mods to load.
